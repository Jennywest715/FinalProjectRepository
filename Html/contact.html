                <h2>It's Okay To Ask for Help</h2>
                <p>Like I had mentioned before I am not a professional if you need help dont be afraid to seek help.<br> So many people are depressed for various of reasons and there is no, "one size fits all" solution.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about">
                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>     I just want to start by saying thank you for being here today. I am just like you, I would have days where I wouldn't want to get out of bed, I dreaded doing anything that took effort. I would literally say," Eh, effort." And that would be the end of that, nothing would get done, and I didn't hold myself accountable to achieve anything. It wasn't just all of a sudden I wanted to start taking care of myself it was many years of wishing I could be a different way, comparing myself to others, obsessing over other people who had better lives than me, or just feeling and being unhappy with everything around me and myself.
                    <br><br>
                        My life wasn't bad, I had a house, a car, a decent job, a husband who cares, a daughter who could totally be worst, I have everything a person could want but, I was still depressed.  I had everything I could want according to the standers set by the culture we live in, and those standards are so wrong! There is so much more that we need, than just a car, a family, or whatever we feel like we may need to have a happy life. Rather than us questioning the standards set for us, we often wonder, "what's wrong with me? Why can't I be like them?"
                    <br><br>
                        I learned that I needed a fulfilling life, with meaning, and purpose. Everyone has their own idea for what is fulfilling, meaningful, and purposeful life, whether that be paying off debts, getting a really well paying  job, or whatever it is that may be. However for me it was my daughter who helped me open my eyes and realize, who do I want this little person to become? Do I want her to be like me? Depressed but surviving? Defiantly not. I wanted her to see what happiness looks like and be able to live a life where she's happy and living her best life. Who was I to show her how to be happy when I was unhappy myself? So on my about page there are some of the very first steps I took to figuring out how to make myself more happy and really get reconnected with myself. There are so many more aspects that go into living a happy and fulfilled life but, I strongly believe that these steps are a great place to start you off in the right direction. The fact that you even try these practices shows you care about yourself, you are willing to help yourself, and that's absolutely wonderful. Don't give up on your journey to finding your happiness, I believe in you.
                    <br><br>
                        -Love, Souphany Jenny West.
