            <h1>What is self-care and how do I do it?</h1>
            <p>    Self-care is not being selfish it simply means taking care of yourself to ensure that you are mentaly, physically, and emotionaly well,<br> you can do your job, you can care for others, and you can do all the things you need to and want to accomplish in a day.</p>        
        </article>

            <h2>How To Start</h2> 
            <img src="../race.jpg">
            <p>    People often wonder, where do I start? What do I do? A lot of times, just like a race people go sprinting out of the start line and end up getting tired to early and give up before reaching the finish line. Our goal is to reach the finish line but there really is no rush, in this race you are not alone. You've got the old you who is right behind you trying to catch up, the you, you want to become is ahead of the race, and then you are right in the middle. It doesn't matter who you were, you are who you are, and the you, you are today is the person we are working with to help you reach that finish line and become the person you want to be. I am no professional by any means and if you need more help please don't hesitate to talk to someone such as a therapist or a life coach.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid">
            <div class="box2">
                <h2>One drop at a time</h2>
                <img src="../waves.jpg">
                <p>    Something to remember is things won't change over night. It has taken so many years to build the person you are today, so take your time. Everything you do from this point on is like a drop of water. One drop of water doesn't seem like very much but, drop after drop you've created a puddle, soon a pond, and one day a vast ocean with unstoppable waves that can change the world around you.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box3">
                <h2>Breath</h2>
                <img src="../breath.jpg">
                <p>    Lets get starters! Just take a moment to breath. Take a big deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, as you take a breath in, say to yourself, " In with the good." Hold that breath in for just a second and when you are ready, exhale and say to yourself, " And out with the bad." Do this a few times to help you reconnect with yourself and your body. Perfect job! This process should be gentle and not forced, and I am here to guide you towards a better version of you. You can always revisit this exercise when you are feeling stressed, overwhelmed, or just need a moment of peace of mind.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box4">
                <h2>Write</h2>
                <img src="../writing.jpg">
                <p>    Taking some time to write will help you greatly. If you have never taken the time to write you may find yourself thinking," What do I even write?" Don't worry I am here for you! A few great ways to start is by make a list of three things you are grateful for, your motivations, things you accomplished today or things you want to accomplish. You can also write to yourself, tell yourself positive things, goals, and anything else that comes to mind for example, "Good Morning! Today is a new day, lets make sure we smile, laugh, be kind, and be strong. I am not perfect but I am who I am and I am amazing and unique. Nobody can change that. I am strong, I am loving, I am priceless." Practice writing everyday, whether that be in the morning, after lunch, or before bed.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box5">
                <h2>Encourage yourself</h2>   
                <img src="../mirror.jpg">
                <p>    For this next exercise you will need a mirror. Now that you have written some positive things about yourself, it's time to say positive things. Find a mirror in a room where you can be alone, whether that's in your room, bathroom, or taking a small mirror into a closet. Look yourself in the eyes and speak to yourself as if you were speaking to someone else who you really love and care about. Tell yourself, " Hey, I know you haven't been living the life you want but you can do it, you deserve it. I love you and I care about you, it hurts to see you living the way you are, feeling the way you feel, I want you to be happy. I know it's hard but you have been through so much worst and survived. I love you, I love you, I love you, you are worth it, love yourself the way you wish people would love you because you can't make people love you but you can learn to love yourself." Actually hearing someone say these things to you mean so much but, hearing it from yourself and meaning it can change your world. hearing it from you, someone who truly cares about you in a way nobody can is truly amazing. At the end of everyday the one person you can count on to be around for you is you.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box6">
                <h2>Healthy habbits</h2>
                <img src="../healthyeating .jpg">
                <p>    Healthy habits are important when it comes to self-care, doing things for yourself that nobody else can do such as eating healthy food, eating amazing foods that taste good, getting up and exercising, going for a walk, doing some stretches, or even dancing by yourself to your favorite tunes are all perfect ways of taking care of and taking time for you.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box7">
                <h2>Keep working on you<br>DON'T GIVE UP!</h2>
                <img src="../care.jpg">
                <p>    Remember that finish line I mentioned before? There really is no finish line, this is something you must keep working on everyday, that old you isn't gone. It just waits and creeps up on you when you start to slow down. Everyday you do these practices is another drop of water added to your soon to be ocean. Keep loving yourself, giving yourself the self-care you need, and never give up. Thank you for being here, give yourself a big pat on the back and tell yourself how proud you are of yourself for being here and doing these practices because, I know I am so proud of you. Remember you are worth it.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="about">
            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>     I just want to start by saying thank you for being here today. I am just like you, I would have days where I wouldn't want to get out of bed, I dreaded doing anything that took effort. I would literally say," Eh, effort." And that would be the end of that, nothing would get done, and I didn't hold myself accountable to achieve anything. It wasn't just all of a sudden I wanted to start taking care of myself it was many years of wishing I could be a different way, comparing myself to others, obsessing over other people who had better lives than me, or just feeling and being unhappy with everything around me and myself.
                <br><br>
                    My life wasn't bad, I had a house, a car, a decent job, a husband who cares, a daughter who could totally be worst, I have everything a person could want but, I was still depressed.  I had everything I could want according to the standers set by the culture we live in, and those standards are so wrong! There is so much more that we need, than just a car, a family, or whatever we feel like we may need to have a happy life. Rather than us questioning the standards set for us, we often wonder, "what's wrong with me? Why can't I be like them?"
                <br><br>
                    I learned that I needed a fulfilling life, with meaning, and purpose. Everyone has their own idea for what fulfilling, meaningful, and purposeful life is, whether that be paying off debts, getting a really well paying  job, or whatever it is that may be. However for me it was my daughter who helped me open my eyes and realize, who do I want this little person to become? Do I want her to be like me? Depressed but surviving? Defiantly not. I wanted her to see what happiness looks like and be able to live a life where she's happy and living her best life. Who was I to show her how to be happy when I was unhappy myself? So on my about page there are some of the very first steps I took to figuring out how to make myself more happy and really get reconnected with myself. There are so many more aspects that go into living a happy and fulfilled life but, I strongly believe that these steps are a great place to start you off in the right direction. The fact that you even try these practices shows you care about yourself, you are willing to help yourself, and that's absolutely wonderful. Don't give up on your journey to finding your happiness, I believe in you.
